        Show icons before the number to indicate whether it exists in the spam database or is there any regex rule that matches it. <br>
        <br>
        At a quick glance, you can effortlessly verify if the history records are covered by the rules, so you don\'t need to test them individually. <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ffa500">Note:</font><br>
        This can impact the performance when there are too many regex rules. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Examples:</b> <br>
        <br>
        <img src=\'ic_history_indicator_1\'/> <br>
        &ensp; - The first green number icon indicates this number will be allowed by a number rule. <br>
        &ensp; - The second red SMS icon indicates this SMS content will be blocked by a content rule. <br>
        &ensp; - The third red database icon indicates this number exists in the spam number database. <br>
        <br>
        These icons are arranged by <font color="#ea86ff"><b>priority</b></font>, the <b>first</b> icon indicates
        the overall result. That number rule has a higher priority, the SMS message will eventually be allowed by it.<br>
        <br>
        <img src=\'ic_history_indicator_2\'/> <br>
        &ensp; - It will be allowed by a content rule. <br>
        &ensp; - It will be blocked by a number rule. <br>
        &ensp; - it exists in the spam number database. <br>
        <br>
        The <b>first</b> icon indicates the message will eventually be allowed by the content rule.<br>
        <br>
        <img src=\'ic_history_indicator_3\'/> <br>
        No number rule matches it, only SMS rule and database. And it will be blocked by an SMS rule.<br>

        Anti SMS Bombing.<br>
        <br>
        Prevent massive, continuous floods of SMS messages, which are often composed primarily
          of OTP (One-Time Password) verifications.<br>
        <br>
        For example, SMS messages like:<br>
        &ensp; <font color="#888888">Your OTP is: 1234.</font><br>
        &ensp; <font color="#888888">This is your verification code: 1234.</font><br>
        &ensp; <font color="#888888">1234 is your validation code.</font><br>
        <br>
        <h5><font color="#00BFFF">- Content regex</font></h5>
        This feature applies only to messages that match this regex, a typical regex would be: <br>
        <font color="#fa7f71">.*(otp|code).*</font><br>
        <br>
        <h5><font color="#00BFFF">- Interval</font></h5>
        If a subsequent OTP message arrives within this time interval, it is considered
          part of the bombing attack and will be blocked.<br>
        (default: 30 seconds)<br>
        <br>
        This will block all following bombs, except for the first one.<br>
        <br>
        <h5><font color="#00BFFF">- Lockscreen protection</font></h5>
        Enable this to block all bombs in lockscreen mode, including the first one. <br>
        <br>
        Usually, your screen should have been unlocked while waiting for a verification code.
        When such messages arrive while the device is in lockscreen mode, they are likely to be bombs.<br>
