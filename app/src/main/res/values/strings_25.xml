        Each filter has its priority value, as the term implies, it dictates the order in which the call is checked. <br>
        <br>
        By Default, <br>
        <br>
        - <highlight>Whitelist rules</highlight> have priority <priority>10</priority> <br>
        &ensp; <sample>E.g. Contacts, RepeatedCall, RecentApps, etc </sample><br>
        <br>
        - <error>Blacklist rules</error> have priority <priority>0</priority> <br>
        &ensp; <sample>E.g. STIR, Database, etc </sample> <br>
        <br>
        When they are both enabled, whitelist rules will override blacklist rules as 10 > 0. <br>
        <br>
        For regex rules, the priority can be set to any number between <priority>-2147483648</priority>
          and <priority>2147483647</priority>. <br>
        Different rules can have the same priority as long as they are the same type, however,
          <warn><b>never assign the same priority to both
          whitelist and blacklist rules</b></warn>, it can cause random behavior. <br>
        <br>
        The feature <title>Meeting Mode</title> has priority <priority>20</priority> by default,
          because it\'s supposed to block any calls during a meeting. <br>
        And <priority>-1</priority> for <title>Instant Query</title>,
          so it only gets checked after the call has passed all local filters. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Use cases</b> of customizing the priority: <br>
        <br>
        - <sample>Always block a particular number, no matter if it repeats</sample> <br>
         &ensp; Set a rule with priority > 10 to override <title>Repeated Call</title>. <br>
        <br>
        - <sample>Always allow a number</sample> <br>
         &ensp; Set it to > 20 to override <title>Meeting Mode</title>. <br>
        <br>
        - <sample>Test a regex rule</sample> <br>
         &ensp; Set it to 999 to override all other filters so you don\'t have to temporarily disable them one by one.
