Prior to other filters below.\n\nIt works by checking the history records in the app\'s database, so do not delete the history records too frequently, receiving text from the same number also counts.\n\nThe default setting \"1 Time / 5 Min\" means the second call within 5 minutes will be permitted.</string>
    <string name="help_contact">When enabled, calls/texts from contacts are permitted.\nWhen disabled, calls/texts will still be checked by other rules.\n\nIf you want to block all non-contact calls/texts, enable this and add a number rule: .*\n\nPrior to other filters below.\n\n</string>

Prior to the filters below.\n\nThe default setting \"5 Min\" means any call will be permitted if any of those apps has been used within 5 minutes, by \"used\" it means being activated, or minimized, or killed.\nOnly works for calls, not for text messages, prior to the filter rules below.</string>
