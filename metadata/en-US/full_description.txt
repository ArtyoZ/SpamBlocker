It silences unwanted calls & SMS messages without replacing your default Call/SMS app. 

Features:

1. Regex filter for number & SMS content.
2. From a contact?
3. Repeated call?
4. Any specific app has been used recently?

Note:
For SMS messages, it works as an "addon" for the default SMS app, it blocks notifications instead of blocking messages.
