Please re-backup.

Breaking change:
- STIR Lenient mode is removed.
  The new "Lenient" label means "don't block unverified call".

New:
- Customizable notification:
  icon, color, sound, LED, grouping
- Workflow trigger: "Call Event" 
  Run a workflow on incoming call. 
  Use case: remove number prefix for "1 SIM card dual numbers"

Fix:
- RepeatedCall/AnsweredNumber, crash that caused by "private" number.
- It asks for wrong permissions after restoring.
- History indicator ignores "for particular number".

Improvement:
- Workflow actions File Read/Write now support date tags, such as `{day_of_week}`.
   Use case: Do a daily backup and only keep last 7 backups.
