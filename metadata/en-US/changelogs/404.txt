New:
- SMS API query
  - Identify SMS using AI, preset: Google Gemini

Fix:
- SMS regex rule can't be disabled

Improvements:
- Language support: Persian(fa)
- PhoneBlock API
  - Query by hash for better privacy.
    The number's SHA1 hash will be sent to the server rather than the number itself. 
    E.g.: query *DF439FA74E14A336F06E2BEE6C26085DA438005C* instead of *+331234567890*.
    To apply this, delete existing configuration and recreate it. 
  - It now uses API key instead of username/password. 
- History log:
    - Show a red indicator when the number exists in the spam database.
  - Menu "Add number to database" becomes "Delete from database" when it already exists.
