New:
- Call Alert, allow all calls after receiving some particular SMS messages, e.g.:
  > (from ...) We are calling you to inform ..., please feel free to answer.

Fix:
- Crash on incoming call or text that caused by complex regex patterns.
- Crash when upgrading from ancient version.

Improvement:
- Test regex directly in the editing dialog, no more "increase priority + global testing".
