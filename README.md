# How it works
It works without replacing your default call/SMS app.
 - For call: <br>
 &ensp; It's the Caller ID app 
 - For SMS: <br>
 &ensp; It takes over the SMS notifications, it only filters the notifications, the spam messages will still be present in the SMS app.
   > ðŸ’¡ Please turn off the notification permission of the default SMS app in system settings, otherwise there will be double SMS notifications.

It's not necessary to leave this app running in the background, you can kill the process after it's configured, if it doesn't work, please refer to [this](https://github.com/aj3423/SpamBlocker/issues/100).

| Instant Query                 | Check the incoming number online in real time, querying multiple API endpoints simultaneously, such as the [PhoneBlock](https://phoneblock.net/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Report Spam                   | Automatically or manually report the number to build our crowd-sourced databases, protecting others and yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Regex<br>(regular expression) | Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/aj3423/SpamBlocker/wiki/Regex-Workflow-Templates) for examples.<br><br>Some typical patterns:<br> - Any number: `.*` (the regex `.*` is equivalent to the wildcard `*` in other apps) <br> - Exact number: `12345` <br> - Start with 400: `400.*` <br> - End with 123: `.*123` <br> - 7 digits: `.{7}` <br> - Shorter than 5: `.{0,4}` <br> - Longer than 10: `.{11,}` <br> - Unknown number (it's actually empty text): `.{0}` or `^$`<br>  - Contain word "verification": `.*verification.*` <br> - Contain any of the words: `.*(police\|hospital\|verification).*` <br> - Start with 400, with leading country code 11 or not: `(?:11)?400.*` <br>- Extract verification code from SMS message: `code.*?(\d+)` |
